I truly enjoy learning and growing alongside the community, and sharing knowledge about C++ is a passion of mine. If you have any questions about the guidelines I presented or just want to chat about C++ in general, feel free to reach out! My email is included in the Meetup event email you received.

For more information about the C++ Default Guidelines, you can visit the project here: [C++ Default Guidelines](https://github.com/janwilmans/guidelines). Letâ€™s continue building great software together!
